I refuse to let July slip by with only one entry, such as June did. Makes it seem pointless to have a journal with only one entry a month. On the other hand, it seems pointless to have a journal whose entries lately consist of "I've been working", "I've been busy at work", and "Geez, it's been reallllly busy at work!"

So hopefully the rest of this jounral entry will be everything BUT work.

How pathetic. I sat here for at least half an hour trying to think of something to write about other than work. I can write about kids, they're doing fine. Cody's physical therapy is coming along well. Gail's been teaching Sarah how to swim, and apparenlty she can swim underwater very well. Now we just have to get her to swim on top of the water.

But other than the occassional game of Starcraft or a new one, Stronghold, over at Jeff's, it's been nothing but work mostly. We did finally manage to get the dark blue wallpaper out of the master bath, so it's much brighter in there. Now, we need to get new sinks, cabinets, and light fixture. Oh, and new shower doors. I found some at Home Depot that I really like.

I also think I might like to add some more color to this site when things cool off at work. Then again, perhaps not. I kind of like the simplicity of it. Thoughts?
