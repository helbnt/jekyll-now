It's finally starting to come back together. Somehow I managed to wrap my brain around the whole update-the-site-from-the-iPad concept, and I seem to be back to posting to this blog like normal. Well, almost normal. There's still a few minor issues to iron out as I see it:
<!--more-->
+ Transfer the host name **i-am.ski** to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
+ Fix the templates so I'm as close to the original [Ghost](https://www.ghost.org) theme I had going (there was a ton of CSS I wasn't using, started with a different base theme this time)
+ Work on integrating [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) (strictly for aesthetic purposes.)
+ Categories! Need to create or import the current category template pages.

And I'm sure there's more to do that I'll think of down the road.

But holy hell, I'm *finally* updating my site from the iPad. That's pretty amazing in my book. This little iPad Pro 11" is a pretty amazing little machine, and being able to utilize even more of its awesomeness it just...well, awesome.
