You know...I hate it when I'm taking a shower, and the shower curtain blows in. It cuts the shower in half, unless you want to shower with vinyl stuck to your backside. So naturally you weigh down the bottom of the shower curtain with shampoo bottles. And you know, if I wasn't married, that would be a problem. When I was on my own, I had one shampoo bottle. Now, there's at least 4 bottles in there: shampoo, conditioner, special face wash, hydroxexfoliatingsomethingortheother...all sorts of cool stuff.
