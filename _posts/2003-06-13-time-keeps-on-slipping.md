There is simply not enough time.
<!--more-->

I have a half dozen things I want to do when I get home from work today. I want to work on the website. I want to start my case mod. I want to get a Windows machine working. I want to clean out my garage. I want to take the dogs for a walk. There's not time for all this AND homework. I have a 5 to 8 page paper due Wednesday for my Psychology class. The bitch of it is, I don't even have a decent subject picked out yet.

I'm starting to panic a bit.

So 90% of this weekend will be spent researching, writing, re-writing, and trying to fill in spaces to make a 5 page paper. Oh, and I have a take home quiz and journal to do.

Summer school sucks. There's just SO much reading to do. A 3 month class shoehorned into 6 weeks is NOT fun...
