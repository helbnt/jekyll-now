I have an odd fascination with how people get the job done. In that I mean, what their tools look like, what their process is, even their work space.

One of the feeds I look forward to reading the most is from [Uses This](https://usesthis.com). Their typical interviewee is usually in the tech sector, but there have been several artists, writers, and performers. I’m drawn to their tools of choice, be it Windows, or Mac. The peripherals they use, and the hardware and software they can’t live without. Some list cameras, and even games they play.

Uses This recently featured [Kris Howard](https://usesthis.com/interviews/kris.howard/), and she offered up a lengthy interview. Which I loved of course. In the *Who are you, and what do you do?* section, I learned in one quick paragraph that she’s working for Amazon in Germany (which she and her partner relocated to in August 2020 from Sydney Australia), that she’s a huge [Roald Dahl](https://www.roalddahlfans.com) fan, and that she’s an award-winning knitter. She’s also been blogging for 20+ years at [https://www.web-goddess.org](https://www.web-goddess.org). So, naturally, I went down that path and discovered she’s posed naked (along with 5000 other people) for Spencer Tunick. Some people really put it all out there.

But back to the tools. For me, it’s a captivating look into what is typically a non-conversation piece. At work, there’ll be tools that are suggested, and workflows to follow... but that’s about as far as the conversation goes. Someone will ask what my hobbies are, and I’ll say music. But I don’t typically say “Oh, I love playing around in [Logic Pro X](https://apple.com/logic-pro) or sometimes [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com), while other times I’ll grab my [PRS SE 24](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/SEStd24TSV8--prs-se-standard-24-tobacco-sunburst) and plug it into my [Fender Mustang amp](https://shop.fender.com/en-US/guitar-amplifiers/contemporary-digital/mustang/) and then play along to some Blues backing tracks on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com). It’s not a typical every day conversational topic.

By the way, there are some really smart and hella-creative people out there. Call it a side benefit to being glued to the Uses This feed. I’ve learned about various conferences, and podcasts, and hobby projects (one person is a member of of the [WesterosCraft](https://westeroscraft.com) project team that is slowly recreating the entire world of Game of Thrones in Minecraft) that I didn’t even have a clue existed.

Heck, one gal is even into [group hugging](https://carolchen.me/blog/group-hugging-theory/). I mean, how cool is that?
