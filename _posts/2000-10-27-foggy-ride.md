Nothing like riding to work in the fog. It's quiet (well, as quiet as you can be on a Harley), the other vehicles loom up out of the fog at you, and disappear as quickly...almost surreal.

So I made it to work ok, and get settled in with a nice cup of hot chocolate to help chase the chill from my cheeks. I read through my email (or is it e-mail??) and discover that I have to ride to one of our other offices to update a machine for an executive type. Oh joy. Oh hooray. It's one thing to be blitzing around (albeit carefully) on a bike in the fog at 7a.m. It's another to have to do it when there's a bunch more traffice out.

C'est la vie.
