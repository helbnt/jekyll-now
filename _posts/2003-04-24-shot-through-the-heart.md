I had to take Sarah to the doctor's office yesterday for her innoculations. The last time she needed shots, I had to take her as well, and that just killed me. Two nurses had to pin her down, with me holding her shoulders and telling her it would be ok. By the time they were done, I had tears in my eyes. I sure didn't take well to seeing my little girl getting scared and hurt like that. So I told Gail that next time, she had to do it.

Naturally, she scheduled the appointment in the middle of the day when she's at work and can't get off. So I was the lucky one who got to take her in to get shots again. Sarah had told me she was worried, and you could tell during the exam. She was jumping and running and all over the place.

When the nurse came in to give the shots, Sarah was going to sit on my lap. By this time, she'd ceased jumping and laughing and was crying. Hard. And hiding behind me as well. Eventually it took me sitting her in my lap, wrapping both arms around her, with one hand holding both of her hands, and I had one leg wrapped around her legs to pin them down. Poor thing was so scared, and screaming to raise the dead. Two shots in one arm, one in the other.

Gail owes me big time.
