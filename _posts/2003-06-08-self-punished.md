I swear, if we get anymore rain, my trees are just going to start falling over. It's that wet right now. Last year, we were in a drought, this year, we're getting a ton. Average for May is about 3-3.5 inches. Last I heard, we were over 7, and that was a week before the month ended. In 23 weekends, we've had only 5 that haven't been at least cloudy, if not raining.

As a result of all this rain, there's been a lot of mud around. I mean, a LOT. Not only in the yard, but in the house as the result of dogs and kids and even grownups (ok, just me) tracking it in. We had our end of the year Indian Guides family bar-b-que yesterday. Lots of families getting together, all for a good time. We went to Claude Moore park, which has a farm on it's premises, with goats, lambs, pigs, roosters and even peacocks. A couple of dads and myself took the kids down to see the animals, and after a bit, started walking back, knowing the kids would catch up. Cody came running up two minutes later and said "I accidently pushed Daniel into a mud puddle". Because of all the aforementioned rain, Cody could have pushed him anywhere and almost guaranteed he'd land in a mud puddle. I looked at him said, "Accidently?".

He didn't even try. He just said. "No, I pushed him into the mud puddle." Naturally, I asked why, and naturally, got the standard "I don't know" answer.

The rest of the day was nice, even though Cody was sullen and moody. I asked what the matter was. "I'm just in a bad mood", he replied. Even though I had a good idea, I asked him why. "I just feel like a bully", he said.

I agreed, saying that his actions do seem to indicate he's a bully, but that I didn't think HE was a bully, and left it at that. Talking to my mom this morning, she made a good point; he was at least thinking about it. He was down on himself because he knew what he did was wrong, and excluded himself from the rest of the afternoon's activities.

Basically, he punished himself, and from where I stand, that's not a bad thing. I can only hope he learned something from it.

And on a totally unrealated noted, I've lost 25lbs so far on the low-carb, high-protein diet. Maybe that explains my carb-binging yesterday at the picnic.

Back on the wagon!!
