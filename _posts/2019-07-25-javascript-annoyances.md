There's a plethora of JavaScript books available for those who learn best by
reading. Every single book I've picked up over the years (and I'm embarrassed to
say how many I have that I've only picked through), has started with "The
History of JavaScript", to some degree.
<!--more-->
This annoys me.. I really don't care about the history. Does a
mechanic open a manual on how to fix an engine and the first chapter is "The
history of the internal combustion engine"? While I haven't checked any manuals
lately, I would bet not. So why does it seem every JavaScript book needs to
delve into the history of the language? The syntax and structure of JavaScript
is nothing like it was back in 1995, much like a modern engine only slightly
resembles an engine from 100 years ago. Maybe that's a bad analogy, as they're
still using combustion to force pistons to turn a crankshaft to power a
drivetrain (man, why hasn't the engine developed past that?), but you get the
idea. I want to get to the practicality of the language, I don't believe I need
to know it was originally called Mocha, then Livescript then blah blah blah.

Another annoyance: I've been going through the freecodecamp Basic JavaScript
lessons, and completed the "Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in
a String" chapter. Not that difficult really, especially if you follow the
example:

```javascript
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];
```

In the case, the first letter (identified by the `[0]`) is A. Ok, great, fairly
simple.

Now what I want to see is a real-world example. When would I need to use
something like that? How can that be a benefit to myself, as a front-end
developer? I feel like there are two levels of JavaScript: those front end devs
like myself, who just want to use JavaScript to add some basic functionality,
and the more experienced programmers who can use it to [launch rockets to the
moon](http://svtsim.com/moonjs/agc.html). Give me some real world examples after
each lesson, and I think the lesson would stick better.
