This weekend is Rolling Thunder, which I will be riding in. For those that don't know, motorcycle riders come from across the country and meet at the Pentagon. They then ride across the bridge to the mall. It's to raise awareness for the POW/MIAs from **all** wars still out there.

Aside from the picnics, BBQs, time off work and such, we should remember what this weekend is for. A time to honor the memory of our vets, and to appreciate that which they fought, and died for.
