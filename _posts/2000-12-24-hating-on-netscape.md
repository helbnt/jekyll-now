Ok, I guess I forgot to make sure it works in [Netscape](http://www.netscape.com). I'm really beginning to <b>HATE</b> Netscape. Don't know why I'm bothering to put a link to it here.

Someone get them on the phone. I want to tell them what a cheap, lying, no-good, rotten, four-flushing, low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed, ignorant, blood-sucking, dog-kissing, brainless, dickless, hopeless, heartless, fat-ass, bug-eyed, stiff-legged, spotty-lipped, worm-headed sack of monkey shit their product is! Hallelujah! Holy shit, where's the Tylenol.

For those that are wondering, that's from [National Lampoons Christmas Vacation](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0097958). I thought it fit well, with a tweak here and there.

Ok, now to back up that little triade with some comments.

They state that the new 6.0 browser complies with [W3](http://www.w3c.org) standards. Which is just fine and dandy. But when your browser has gone from a majority of the market to something like 16%, you **have** to be willing to do more. Look at Microsoft. I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft, but the browser is far superior to anything Netscape has come up with. IE support table backgrounds, CSS1 and CSS2, tables are MUCH easier to deal with in IE than they are in Netscape...ARG

~~The picture, by the way, is what a part of my page looks like in NS6. Sure didn't look like that in MSIE 5.5.~~

I'm just freaking fed up with the stupid thing. I could go on and on about problems I've had with it. The Java plug-in for the Linux platform doesn't install properly; the prefrences were obviously not tested fully when using different themes; even their tech support sucks. I wrote asking about the prefs problem, and 3 weeks later (3 weeks!), they wrote back and said:

> Dear Valued Netscape Customer,<br>
> We thank you for your inquiry and appreciate your patience. We are receiving a much greater than anticipated volume of interest and apologize for any delay in response that you may have encountered. We realize that you may have sought out other sources of support. If you continue to experience problems with Netscape please reply to this message with a brief synopsis of the problem as well as any new behavior you may have noticed from the problem. Upon receiving your response a Netscape technician will respond to your request in the order in which it was received.<br /><br />Netscape Technical Support

Now that was helpful. Notice the **"a much greater than anticipated volume of interest"**? Translated, that means "Holy shit, we didn't expect this much mail about our crappy product!!"

And another thing: This has been touted as a browser for "Core Internet Users"...and what does it do? Sends you to shopping channels on every third click of the button, or so it seems. Yeah, as a hardcore Internet user, my main purpose is to shop. Isn't everyones?

Ok, I think I'd better stop ranting and see about getting my layout to play nice with Netscape. Besides, I have a headache now.

The preceeding has been a public service announcement from Shad, and it's his own opinion and nothing else. So don't sue me Netscape or you'll just piss me off more.
