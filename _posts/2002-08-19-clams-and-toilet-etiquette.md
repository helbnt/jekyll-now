title: Clams and Toilet Etiquette

I was up late last night, watching The Green Mile and folding laundry. Folding laundry is a task I can do with minimal fuss, as long as I can watch the TV while doing it. So I usually get to fold the laundry. And I'm happy to do it, as long as there's something worth watching on. But I digress...

Anyways, I'm sitting there watching the movie and folding laundry at about 11 p.m. last night when I hear Cody get out of bed. He comes out of his room, and without really seeing me, he starts heading downstairs. I asked him where he was going, and he said he was getting some water for the clams. He stood there at the top of the stairs for a minute, while I held my silence waiting to see what he would do. When he didn't do anything for a minute or two, I told him to go back to bed. He simply turned around and climbed back into bed without any fuss.

At least he didn't feel the need to go to the store to get the dogs some dogfood or anything.

My weekend was very unproductive, and goal-less. Well, I take that back; I did have one goal that I wanted to accomplish, and that was staying barefoot for all day on Sunday. And I accomplished it! Hooray for me. Other than that, I worked on the forums for my harleyroads site, and I went to a friends house on Friday night. Taught them how to play Asshole, got them pretty torqued, and managed to get home around 3:30 in the morning. It was a lot of fun though.

Ok, that was odd. I took a quick run down to the bathroom to, well, to do what you do in the bathroom. I was standing at one urinal, and guy who is on my team was standing at the other. He'd just gotten back from vacation (lucky bastard) so I welcomed him back and asked how the beach was. He said it was nice, but that he'd actually gotten back last week. Then I remembed it was a different guy on our team who was back today. By this time, we'd both zipped up and were washing our hands, when this voice came from the stalls and said "Oh, is he back?" It was our boss in the stall, doing what guys do in stalls. It was a strange moment to be sure.

Bathroom etiquette is simply odd. I mean, EVERYONE has to pee or poop at some point in their lives. Yet, whenever we're in the bathroom (at least men...I don't know if women do it any differently), it's like there's this "No Talking" sign posted. Some people abide by that sign as if it were written law, while others seem to go out of their way to flaunt their disregard for such silliness. Personally, I fall into the latter catagory. The people that crack me up the most are the guys that sit in the stall, and flush everytime they're going to make some noise (i.e. fart). Every thirty seconds, they'll flush the toilet. C'mon, we all know you're not going THAT much. And if you are, perhaps you should see a doctor!

Well, this entry certainly did get a bit off track. Ah well. At least I didn't talk about work :)
