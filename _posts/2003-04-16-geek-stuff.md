For some reason, I got a bug and decided to make the site here W3C compliant. I validated both the HTML code as well as the CSS. I had a ton of things wrong in the HTML, mostly stuff I'd neglected to take out in the Greymatter templates, and it probably took me about a half hour to get straighted out. The CSS was error-free, just some warnings that I didn't have certain expected elements in my link classes. Two minutes later, all was fine and dandy.

I was going to change, or was thinking about changing at least, the layout of the site. I think I'll hold off on that however, and instead, go with a different layout under the soon to be opened (I hope) graphics section. Naturally, being a "graphics" section, it is going to be a much more graphical interface, as well as some CSS/PHP eye-candy goodiness. At least, that's the plan. And Lord knows how many plans I've had that've gone astray.
