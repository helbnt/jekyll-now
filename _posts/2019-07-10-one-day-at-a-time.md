No, not the old sitcom.

In the quest to learn (insert subject here), it's important to practice a bit
every day. At least for me. Some days, however, are quite the challenge for me.
I want to get better at Javascript, but I find myself bouncing around topics.
Three days ago I was going back through the [freecodecamp.org](http://freecodecamp.org) Basic Javascript curriculum and making my way (again)through their tutorials. Yesterday, for some reason, I started watching a React tutorial on Youtube. I keep telling myself I need to learn to walk before running, but my scatterbrained self gets distracted easily. And then some days I
don't want to practice coding at all and instead want to play within [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/), or [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com), or [Reason](https://www.reasonstudios.com).

Maybe I need to practice focusing on one particular project. Perhaps there's a
YouTube video about that... oh, look, "The Office" bloopers!
