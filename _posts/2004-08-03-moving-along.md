I’ve been meaning to write about our most recent trip back to Arizona for my grandmother’s funeral service, but work, along with other miscellanous things, kept getting in the way. As usual.

The service was very nice. My Uncle Eddie got up and talked about my grandmother’s life, and much of it I’d never even heard. How she eloped with my grandfather. How she wasn’t allowed to be married while in Nursing School, and when word reached the administration that she was married, how she was expelled. It was like discovering a whole different side of my grandmother.

My cousin Kim, being the oldest of the grandchildren, was next to speak. She took all of our memories of summers spent at Nana’s and recounted them to the people at the service. It was wonderful and emotional and I miss her even more after listening to everything I’d forgotten. If I can get Kim to send me what she wrote, I’ll post it here.

Aside from the services, it was really a nice time. It was great seeing all my family together again, and I had a good time catching up with everyone. My in-laws were coming through town on the day of the service, so they brought the kids (who have been staying with my in-laws since the end of June) and Gail and I got to visit a bit.

I also got to drive my Aunt Nadine’s Mercedes SL 500. Ooooh my. Talk about a damn cool car. It’s a hardtop convertible, and when the top is down, it’s just sweet.

Gail and I also made it to Chandler Harley-Davidson, where we got to see some of the new models. She also sat on a Duece again, and is now looking at accessories for one like she was getting it. Just the fact that she’s thinking of getting one makes me all a-tingle. First thing’s first: the Motorcycle Safety Foundation class!!!
