One week and counting!

So much to do. Have to get my crap together and pack it on the bike. I want to make a run this Saturday with everything on the bike so I know what kind of load I'm traveling with. I need to get some tools together. Rig a water bottle holder. Find someone to take care of the cat.

Get money. Woo...get a tattoo with the money. Maybe in Sturgis :) For those that don't know what Sturgis is...well, you can write me!
