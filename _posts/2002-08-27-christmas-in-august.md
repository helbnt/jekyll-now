Wow...can you believe there is only 125 days left until Christmas? Ack! Quick!! Start shopping!

Heh. I know the 2 of you that are reading this are probably sittin' there in shorts (unless you're my mom) and thinking "Ok, he's off his rocker". Well, ok, yeah, so I probably am. I just happened to be looking ahead in my calendar, figuring out when my classes were in such, when I decided to count the days.

One of things that bothers me about the holiday season (ok, one of many, but I'll wait until it gets closer to talk about them all) is when people ask me what *I* want. I have a pretty standard answer: Gift Certificates. I love getting gift certificates, because then I get to choose exactly what I want, the person shopping for me doesn't have shop for hours, and everyone is happy. Who wouldn't love getting gift certificates? I love getting gift certificates from Best Buy, Barnes & Nobel and Borders. Those are probably my favorites of the "Brick and Mortar" crew. I love Amazon gift certificates as well.

However, there are some people who just aren't happy with buying gift certificates. Those people aren't content unless they spend hours shopping for the person in question. I think it must be a gene or something. My mother-in-law is one of these types, and I think my wife is following in her footsteps. So, for those that absolutly must shop, I've created "wish lists", at both Harley-Davidson and Amazon.com. If you get me something off of one of these lists, I'm guarenteed to love it. So no worries about me not liking anything. To access my particular wish list, just select the link over there on the right side, at the bottom.

These lists, or more specifically, the Harley-Davidson one, serve a dual-purpose. Aside from those who want to actually buy something, it's a good way to keep track of what I want to get for my bike/HD collection. Too many times I've seen something and thought, "Oh, that'd be cool", only to be thinking "What was that again?" just a few days later. I didn't want you guys thinking I was just making lists so people could by me stuff. I mean, c'mon, I'm not THAT materialistic.

Am I? :)
