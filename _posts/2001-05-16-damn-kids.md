I so wouldn't want to be in Cody's shoes right now. His teacher is supposed to send home "weekly reports" every Friday. She forgot it last Friday, so she gave it to him yesterday. She found it on the floor under a desk this morning, so she taped it to Cody's desk. After the kids had come in, then gone back out for recess, she found it in the trash. When she confronted him about it, and told him that she was calling his mom, he just said "uh oh, busted".

Gail is now on her way to the school to sit in his class. I sure wouldn't want to be him...
