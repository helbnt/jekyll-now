Gail's off to Tampa today. Actually, she's already in Tampa, she just called me from the motel they are staying at. [The place](http://www.wyndham.com/) they are staying at sound pretty nice, and they (they, being Gail and her friend Marcia) rented a Mustang Convertible.

Sounds rough. No kids, hot car, sitting by the pool. I'm sure she's just going to **hate** it...uh huh.

So it's the kids and I this week. Gail was apprehensive about leaving us. It's not like I can't take care of the kids all by myself. I mean hey, I can make a mean PB&J Sandwich when I put my mind to it. And no one makes a better bowl of cereal than I. And laundry? Heck, I used to live on my own, I can do laundry. Although, I have to say, since I've been married, none of my socks or underwear are pink anymore...

I've started working out again. Helps when you have someone to go with, so my friend Heidi and I are going during lunch now. It's a good time to go: It's not crowded, and I feel energized for the rest of the afternoon, which is when I'm most likely to start feelin drowsy. We'll see if I can keep it up this time. I managed to do the elliptical machine for 45 minutes today. Wish me luck!
