One of the things I've decided I need to do is to follow through on some of my ideas, complete projects in a decent amount of time, and generally get things done. I've been wanting to try modding my own PC case, and have been reading forums and how-to's, and I've even gone so far as to strip a case I had lying around down to the bare bones. But I haven't ever bothered to start the actual work.

The reason I bring this up is because of a site I recently saw. The Mushroom House is the creation of a guy (strangly enough, named "Zube") who came up with the idea in the late '70s (ok, maybe not that strange of a name, considering the decade...). It's an incredible piece of work, with detail that's just astounding. The house itself, interior and exterior, reminds me of a hobbit hole, and the whole "nature" motif is carried throughout the house. 

Obviously Zube (I love saying that name) must have had an incredible passion, for this took 22 years to complete. The only thing I've done for 22 years is breathe. I'd like to have this kind of determination and desire to have such a vision, and decide to do it, however out of this world the idea might seem.
