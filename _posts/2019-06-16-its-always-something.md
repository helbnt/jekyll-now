title: It's Always Something
---

Here I was, all excited about getting a new blog underway, with a new CMS to
practice with, and of course, I blow it up within a day.

Which was stupid. I'm familiar enough with child-themes, having built a few with
Wordpress. But my brain apparently checked out, and I went and heavily modifed
the bootstrap-blog theme I was using. And then the next day, [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) notified me of updates that needed to be done. Being a good little web developer (ha), I always
try to get updates in as soon as possible. Gotta keep those files up-to-date so
the site stays secure, right?

So I updated Grav, as well as the theme, and everything just went to shit, to
put it bluntly. It took me the better part of the day to figure what I'd done,
and quite frankly, I'm still not sure I'm 100% certain what happened. On top of
that, I don't even know why the new page I added -- once I had everything back
to looking 90% of how it was -- won't show. It was a simple About page, but if I
try to visit it, it just leads to the default home page (which is just my blog
listings).

So back to the drawing board. Part of the reason I stopped debugging to write
this out is sort of as a test. I want to make sure at least the blog posts show
up. I can work on the individual pages seperately, just as long as the blog
posts continue.

Fingers crossed!
