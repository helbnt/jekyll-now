One of the things Gail and I have been dealing with the past few weeks/months now is Cody's lying. For some reason, he's been lying about anything and everything and it's the stupidest stuff he lies about. A lot of it deals with school work, but the truly annoying lies are ones such as him lying about whether he used toothpaste on his toothbrush, used shampoo, silly stuff like that. It just gets SO old. He'd been saying that the reason he missed "Whacky Wednesday" (a free time for the kids that earn it at school) the past two weeks in a row was because he hadn't received a handout that was due. He's telling us that for two weeks the teacher hasn't given him the paper when she passes it out, but that she's been giving it to all the other kids.

Yeah...right.

So Monday I called his teacher and got things straightened out. Turns out that after she passes out the papers, she asks if anyone didn't get one, and then puts the leftovers in a tray on her desk for those that might have lost theirs. After I sat Cody down and confronted him about all this (And one lie just kept leading to another, even while we were sitting there), it turns out he had all the papers in his desk. With Gail's "encouragement" I kept it very toned down (though I wanted to bend him over my knee and spank his butt like a 5 year old), and mostly positive. Encouragement instead of negativity, praising him for the great grades he brought home last week. It's a good thing Gail was there, because she had the right of it. He responds so much better when we're positive, instead of nagging him to get his homework done (after he sits there for 3-4 hours, it gets annoying).

So, on top of regular homework, we had him bring home his class work, which we're helping him through. Only 6 weeks of school left. I really hope next year he gets a stricter teacher. He does so well with a teacher who's a hard ass :)

As for Sarah...well, I have a feeling she might be more trouble. Aside from the "Go faster daddy" when I'm driving to the "play louder daddy" when I'm playing my guitar, she pulled a new one on me last night. I'd just gotten her out of the bath, and was drying her hair with the towel, and with exaggerated motions, tousled her hair. She laughed and laughed and then said "Daddy! Stop that! I'm a GENIUS and geniuses don't GET their hair dried!"

I just sat there with my mouth open, towel in my hand, as she streaked out in the living room giggling her head off.
