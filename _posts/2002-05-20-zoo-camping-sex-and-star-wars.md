If you've never camped in a zoo, I suggest trying it. The Catoctin Wildlife Preserve and Zoo up in Maryland offers a package where you get to camp in the zoo overnight, they feed you both dinner and breakfast, and you get a twilight tour of the zoo, as well as some entertainment on their stage. It was a lot of fun, and Cody and I really enjoyed it. The zoo itself is fairly nice, and they have a good selection of animals. I tell ya, there is nothing like being awaken by lemurs hootin' and hollerin' at 4:30 in the morning. They get LOUD.

It was a fairly busy weekend overall. Cody had a ball game Saturday afternoon, then we had to bust our asses up to Maryland to make it to the zoo by 6. On the way there, we had the first of what I imagine will be a few "sex" talks. After I explained the basics to him, he was silent a moment, then went "EEEEEWWWWW!!!! I am NEVER getting married!!" I just had to laugh. So after a few minutes, and some more explanation, I told him that if he had any questions about any of this stuff, that I wanted him to come to his mother or I, and we would do our best to answer him honestly and fairly. Then I asked if he had any questions and he said yes. So I braced myself for my first related sex question and he said:

"What I want to know, is what you think the most ferocious dinosaur is after the Tyrannosaurs Rex."

Okie Dokie then. Not exactly what I expected, but for some reason, it didn't really surprise me either.

Sunday I went to my friend Jon's to start work on his new website. He's going to do the graphics, and I'm going to help with the coding of it. I'm pretty excited about it. Jon's very talented when it comes to that stuff, and I like working with him. After about 2 hours of working, we decided to go see a movie, so went and saw the new Star Wars film. I have to say, I liked it a lot. You can read my whole review over here.

After that it was home to relieve Gail of a frustrating afternoon of dealing with barking dogs. We really need to get a fence.
