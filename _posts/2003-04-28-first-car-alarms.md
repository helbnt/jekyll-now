So, Friday afternoon/evening, we're having power problems. Stays on for 20 minutes, goes out for an hour to an hour and a half. This continues all evening (twice while I was online. You'd think I'd have gotten the hint the first time....).

Around 11:15 it comes back on again, and something happened to the neighbor's home security system. It starts going off on it's own accord. Nice, LOUD annoying "BREEEP BREEEP BREEEP *pause* BREEEP BREEEP BREEEP..." and so on. I could not get to sleep until about 4:30am because of that damn thing. I even took a walk up the road at 3am to take a look and see if I could disconnect it, because, obviously by now, there was no one home.

Turns out the homeowners had dropped the security service that monitors the alarms, but kept the alarm hooked up. And, naturally, the homeowners were out of town. Friggin' wonderful.

It didn't get shut off until 4pm Sunday afternoon.

I'd better get a nice bottle of beer from them or something.
