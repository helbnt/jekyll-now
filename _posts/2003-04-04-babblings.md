Weather wise, it's been a weird week. Sunday and Monday it was cold and snowing. Wednesday and Thursday, it was gorgeous, high 70s. Naturally, I rode the bike in to work both days. Today, it's supposed to be in the low 70s. Riding to work this morning, it was cold, and there was patchy fog. My cheeks were freezing when I got here. I hope it does get to that promised 73 degrees.

I'm settling into my new role as QA tester type person. On my first "real day" of working as a tester, they gave me some stuff to test (naturally). Real basic stuff, entering difference values for different parameters for our new bug tracking software. I changed a few things, everything was good. Then I thought to myself "well, what if I did this?", and ended up breaking the whole system. I broke our bug tracking system, but not only that, I apparenlty broke the system it was based off, as well as created some firewall issues for the west coast people.

Man, do I know how to do my job or what?? What's even better is the fact that I get to break it and don't have to fix it. That rules.

Otherwise, it's spring. Flowers are blooming, Cody is in baseball and is starting to count down the days until Spring Break (so is Gail for that matter). Cody's Oddesy of the Mind took second place in their school and we're all headed to Newport News for the State competition next weekend. No one expected them to get placed, as this is the first year for their school, but they surprised everyone. We were pretty damn proud of him!

Sarah is starting to talk about going to school in the fall. I think she's looking forward to it. And I think she'll do well. She's one of those that really likes to please others, and gets very upset if someone becomes upset with her. Guess she might be classified as "teachers pet".

The dogs have been attention starved or something lately. They've been getting into the trash, getting up on the furniture again. So we've been letting them sleep in the room (They're really annoying in the middle of the night. For some reason, that appears to be their preferred time to wash themselves and at 1 in the morning, we're awaken by the sound of dogs licking themselves. Just nasty..). We even managed to all go for a walk last night. Hopefully, now that it's turning nice out, we'll do more of that.

I have a "diet buddy"! A good friend of mine is wanting to lose weight, and as I'm always bitching about how fat I am, she asked me to help her out, and in turn, she'll help me. So we've made goals, and we encourage (read: nag) each other about what to eat, what not to eat, when we've exercised, etc. Hopefully it'll work, and I'll be able to stick to an exercise/diet plan. I seriously need to lose some serious amount of weight!

And other than all that happy rambling, have a good Friday!
