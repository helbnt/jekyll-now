And of course, because I had a good Friday, I'm going to have a crap Monday. Well, I might not have an entirely bad crap Monday. But it's not starting out very well, that's for sure.

My computer has decided that it needs to be rebooted about every 20 minutes, and it tells me this by locking everything on the screen. My shoulder STILL hurts (tore it up about 6 weeks ago...my mom says it's rotor cup related. weee. Thanks ma) and I didn't get to go riding at ALL This weekend.

This weekend was busier than a one legged man in an ass-kicking contest. We had Sarah's Birthday party, Cody's Little League game, Cody's End-of-the-season team party, and a halloween party. And that was all on Saturday.

ugh.

Gail and I are going to be spending most of the next 2 weeks cleaning, as her parents are coming to stay with us for three weeks starting the 9th of November. Gotta make my computer area all nice and neat. Darn.
