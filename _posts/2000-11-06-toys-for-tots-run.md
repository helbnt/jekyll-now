I meant to post this yesterday afternoon, when I got back, but for some reason, I never got around to it. The largest group ride I've ever been on prior to today was about 25 bikes. Today, I met with a group of about 30 at the dealership for the [Toys for Tots](http://www.toysfortots.org/) run. From there, we headed down to Classic Iron where, we met up with about 500-750 more bikes for the run to Fredricksburg. Yup, you read that right. Between 500 and 750 motorcycles. It was way cool (And loud!). There were bikes everywhere...mostly Harleys, but there were also BMWs, Ducatis, Hondas, Yamahas, Kawazakis. You name it, it was there.

The Toys for Tots run is sponsered by the [United States Marine Corps](http://www.usmc.mil/">) every year, to help get toys, and raise money for those less fortunate during the holidays. It's a great cause, and I'm glad Gail kicked my butt outta bed this morning to go. They had one vendor there, and one concession stand. However, this is the first year they've done this, so I suspect next year it'll be even better.

There was a radio station onsite doing a live broadcast, and they were doing USMC and [Harley-Davidson](http://www.harley-davidson.com) triva. First question was; what was the first names of the Davidson brothers? I happen to be close to the the table, so I wandered down there, gave the right answer, and received a set of Mac tools. Well, it was two screwdrivers, and a tape measure, but it was still pretty cool :) (The answer, in case you're wondering, is Arthur, William, and Walter)

So after grabbin' some grub, and chattin' some, I headed home. I like riding in groups, but I think I like alone better, or with just one or two other people. It was a wonderful ride back up 17 to 28. Sad to say though, I believe this will the be last good ride of the season. I'm sitting here in sweats and am just **now** warming up. My fingers were cold, my knees were cold...getting to be that time of the year!
