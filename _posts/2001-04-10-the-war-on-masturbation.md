You know, there are just some really strange people out there, with really strange notions of what's morally right in the world.

Case in point? [Americans For Purity: Winning The War On Masturbation](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424065705/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/senate/2680/index.html) _2020 Edit: dug up the archive.org link because it's just too damn funny_

Now, how stupid is that? At first, I thought it was a joke, and perhaps it is. But this person speaks with such conviction that I myself am not all that convinced. It's amazing what happens when stupid people have a medium for expressing themselves. Granted, everyone has that right, but geez man...why pick on something as harmless as masturbation?

You know, maybe if this guy yanked his crank a time or three, he wouldn't feel so uptight.

And mom, if this offended you, I apologize (Though I really doubt it did anything of the sort. She's probably laughing her ass off)
