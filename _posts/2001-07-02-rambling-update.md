**_whew_** Long time no post. No real reason for lack of updates. I can do this from work, from home, from anywhere I have net access. That's the wonderful thing about Blogger, I can update from pretty much anywhere.

[Harleyroads.com](https://www.harleyroads.com) is coming along. I'm halfway through my models section. Once I get that up, I'll probably open the site, and then finish it as I go. I'm getting excited about it.

Otherwise, it's the same old same old. Kids and I are going down to my moms for the 4th of July weekend. Gail is staying here to work at her part time job, full time. She took a weeks vacation from her full time to work full time at the part time, while her part time boss(es) go on vacation.

Get all that? :)
