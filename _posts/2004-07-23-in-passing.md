Looks like I’ll be heading back to Arizona a lot sooner than expected. My mom called last night to let me know that my grandmother had passed away.

I can’t tell you how grateful I am that we got to spend time with her just this past month. It was wonderful to see her, and she seemed in great health and spirit. I guess that’s why when my mom called to tell me the news, it came as such a shock. I think I’m still in a bit of shock. It certainly hasn’t sunk in yet.

After the service, my mom and aunt (and uncle I’m assuming) will be taking my grandmothers ashes, along with my grandfathers (who died 18 years ago) to South Dakota, where she grew up. There they’ll bury her in the Black Hills, which is beautiful country indeed. It’ll be a good final resting spot.

God Bless Nana. I sure will miss you.
