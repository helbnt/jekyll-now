Finally saw [The Perfect Storm](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0177971) last night. Gail loved that movie so much when she saw it in the theatres, she bought it as soon as it was available on DVD. It's rare that I buy a movie I haven't seen before, but this was a good one. I really enjoyed the story, and the special effects rocked.

After work I get to go to Maryland: First, to pick up a treadmill from my buddy Heidi, then to Jon'sAwesome. Mostly to stop in and say hi, but he's also going to loan me all of his darkroom equipment. I've been wanting to get into photography for awhile, however, I've just never had the resources. Jon's a font of resources though. I have his [helmet](http://www.shoei.com/) his [Dazzle](http://www.dazzle.com), and now his darkroom equipment. Maybe he should just move in.
