I'm tired. And I'm whiney. And I don't wanna do anything but sit here and do nothing.Perhaps that's part of the problem. That's what I'm doing.

I'm feeling so lethargic right now. I don't feel like doing anything at all. Even if my boss came in and said "Shad, take the rest of the day off, and go home", I couldn't say that I would go home and do something productive, like yardwork, or fun, like riding my bike. I'd probably end up in bed. I'm **SLEEPY**.

Getting back into the habit of writing stuff down is harder than I thought it would be. I keep finding myself putting it off, with one excuse after another. So why do I bother? Well, I like reading what I was thinking prior. I'm also trying to get into the habit because I want to keep a journal when I go on my trip to [Sturgis](http://www.sturgis-rally.com/) this coming August. My buddy Jeff and I are riding there and back. No trailering of the bikes will be happening here. It's just something I've always wanted to do. And I want to record my thoughts about the trip as I go. I think I'll have to resort to keeping my journal the old fashioned way, with pen and paper, but I'm going to write in it every night. And take pictures. I want to take lots of pictures.

I think it's also time to redesign the site. It is spring time after all, time to do a little spring cleaning. I think something simple, brighter, and easier to maintain will fit the ticket just right. No idea when I'll get to it though. Still have to finish [Harleyroads.com](http://www.harleyroads.com"), my brother wants me to do a [Tribes2](http://www.tribes2.com) site for his tribe, and I need to get on the ball and get Gail's site, and her [DAR](http://www.dar.org) site up and going.

Damn, now wonder I'm so tired. I never have time. And dang...just remembered Cody has a baseball game tonight. Ugh.

I think I need a pillow in my office.
