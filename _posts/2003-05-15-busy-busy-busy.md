The Matrix Reloaded opened last night in my neighborhood theater. I bought tickets a week ago when I heard they were having "preview" showings, and myself and 6 of my friends all went.

You can check my review here, but in short, it was a one helluva good flick.

I also won a drawing here at work where I get to go see it tonight for free, and as a team, we're going tomorrow afternoon to see it as well. Good thing I liked it. :)

In other news, I think I've actually settled on a major. I think I'm going to go for a Psychology major, with a minor in Film and Media Studies. Why Film and Media? I've always loved movies, love the Internet, and find the way the media in general can manipulate the public thought process fascinating and disturbing. That interest should tie in nicely with the Psych degree.

Sarah "graduates" from daycare today. I'm in work early today so I can leave around 9-ish, and go watch the ceremony. Should be very cute, and I hope to have pictures up shortly after (though I'm taking my 35 mm and not my digital, which in itself wouldn't be a problem if Canon would make a flippin' scanner driver for my Mac, which runs OS X. There's another company that has, but they want 50 bucks...but I digress)...

Cody has SOL tests today (Standards Of Learning), which is a nice, 4 hour long test. He then has a game tonight (he had one last night as well), so I imagine by tomorrow he'll be worn out. Gail and I are getting stuff together for a garage sale we're having Saturday. I discovered I have more computer parts and software than I ever thought, so I'm selling 95% of it. Hopefully, once Gail sees how cleaned out the basement is, she'll let me go buy more crap...er...computer stuff!

Once this weekend is over, we have to start cleaning like mad, as my Mother-in-law (queue Darth Vader music!...just kidding Lou!!!!) is coming to town for a wedding, in which Gail and I are in. And then starting Thursday is the HOG VA State Rally, with Rolling Thunder smack dab in the middle of it...

It is going to be a very busy week.
