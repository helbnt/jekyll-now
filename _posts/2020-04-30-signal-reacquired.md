After a failed update and a couple of months of apathy, I'm finally back to having my site looking how I want. Simple and clean is the name of the game here.

The fallout took place when trying to update [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and basically things did not go well. I wasn't in the mood to troubleshoot (again!) after that first go round, so I figured I'd revisit later. Later became days, which turned into weeks... before I knew it, five months had gone by and I was still looking at the "I broke it again" html page I'd thrown up.

I decided to move on from Ghost, and opted instead for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. The big benefit here is there's not a need for a database. No database means less maintainence, less overhead, fewer options for script kiddies to try to take over my site (who'd want to??). It also uses [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which is something I've been wanting to get more familiar with.

I'm also going to collect all my previous posts (at least those that I can find) and import them here. There are posts from [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com) and [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) that date back quite some years. I plan on dating them when they were originally posted, so there will be posts back from the early 2000's. I won't be posting items that were simple one liners ("It's snowing!" for example) and would've been better off as tweets.

Now on to the fun of importing entries and ripping out all the extraneous markup that some of these tools add. Joy.
