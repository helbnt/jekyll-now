Took my brother to the train station last night. He's off to "the big city"...New York City that is. He's finally got all his crap together and moved up there. Gonna miss him. But he'll be back for Christmas, and it's only a 3 hour train ride up there. I'll make it up there to see him sooner or later.

During the day we cleaned his car, because he had to sell it. He said all the change I found, I could keep and put in my chrome jar. I bet I walked away with over 5 bucks in change. He's worse than I am.<P><br /><br />We took his car to [Carmax](http://www.carmax.com) to sell. I have to say, I was impressed with the place. Next time I go buy a car (hopefully soon. The poor little Honda's on it's last legs) I'll be going there.
