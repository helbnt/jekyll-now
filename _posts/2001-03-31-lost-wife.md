Gail's lost.

I'm sitting here at her desk at her work, waiting for her to come get me. The original plan was for her to drop me off here, I was going to update a computer here, and while I was doing that she was going to go to an art supply store and get some clay. She called about 45 minutes ago, saying she had gotten lost, but was on her way back finally. Then she called again about 5 minutes ago. She'd gotten herself even more lost, and was hungry and grouchy. I'm sure it didn't help I was laughing at her. At least the kids were asleep.

So I'm sitting her at her desk, using her computer to update my journal. At least she has a net connection here.
