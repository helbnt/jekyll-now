It's gotten busy at work.

I mean... BUSY.

For a few months there I didn't have much to do. Mostly bug fixes here and
there. And then we had a new project start and I was given the Bootstrap/UI
duties for that team. And then a second project spun up, and it was decided I
could be a "shared resource", and I was given the Bootstrap/UI duties for that
project.

And then third project came about.

And a fourth.

Currently, I am on five scrum teams. Yes. Five. Now, I don't always have work or
bugs for all teams at any given time, but there are days when I'm heads down for
a solid 8-10 hours.

It shouldn't (hopefully) be for long. If it is, I'll burn out. Thankfully I have
a good scrum master who's always checking my point totals and making sure I'm
not going batshit crazy. Two sprints ago I was given a total of 13 points. A
full sprint's effort is typically 8. That was a crazy week.

But hey, at least I'm not bored.
