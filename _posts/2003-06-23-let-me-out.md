The previously mentioned jackasses actually came forward and apologized to the neighbor, gave her money, and helped clean up. Well, 2 of the 7 did. I'm glad at least that they took responsibilities for their own actions; that's a rare thing these days...

I'm supposed to QA testing our latest client build...I just can't. It's such a gorgeous day out, that I want to go riding, do some work around the house, do anything but work on the computer. And that says something...not only not wanting to work on the computer, but work around the house...I hate house maintenance stuff, but I feel like getting out and cleaning flower beds, or something.

Weird.

Hopefully, with Gail being home during the summer, she'll get to get out and do some of that stuff. She at least likes it. Me, I just view it as a chore. One which I usually have to spend money on. I don't have any money as it is. It never seems like we have enough money. They say that the key to happiness isn't all about money, and I agree, for the most part. A little bit more money sure would help though!
