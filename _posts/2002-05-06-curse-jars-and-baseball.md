I've implemented a curse jar in our house. Gail has a toilet mouth, so now every time she curses, she has to pay a quarter to it. This includes crap, damn(it), and Gail's favorite, dumb-ass. Within half an hour of my setting it up, there was a buck in there.

She was in bed, reading, after having made her first deposit to the curse jar. She was reading an article about how some guy in California is cryogenically freezing hair so that when a cure for baldness is absolute, men can get their hair out of storage, and have it grafted (or whatever) back on to their head. She then said "Only in California would they come up with this bullshit...oh Crap! Oh DAMNIT!" At this point, she shoved a kleenex in her mouth to keep from cursing more. Needless to say, she almost double the amount of money in the curse jar within about 10 seconds.

It was an enjoyable weekend. Cody had a game on Saturday, which they actually won. It's the first game this year that they've won, which had everybody pretty jazzed. The coach even did this high-step thing through the dugout when they got the last out. I ended up having to leave early, and go to my bosses office to get a standing table and bring it back to work. A standing table is for parapalegics (My boss is in a wheelchair), and allows them to stand up for periods of time. It'll be kinda weird to have him standing up when I go in there.

Sunday, we went to Camden Yards and watch the Orioles beat the Kansas City Royales. It was a good game, made better by the fact that I didn't get any more sunburned than I already was. Camden Yards is a neat ballpark, and we had pretty decent seats down the third-base line. I'd like to go more often, I just wish it wasn't so far away.

Afterwards, we came back, picked up Sarah (she spent the day over at Marcia's for Olivia's birthday party...another fact which probably added to my enjoyment of the game) and then got the kids home, got them fed, got them washed and got them to bed (Ugh...so many 'got's...my dad would be horrified). Gail and I spent the rest of the evening watching Bull Durham, a movie she hadn't seen.

It was a pretty decent weekend. Too bad it had to be spoiled by Monday :\
