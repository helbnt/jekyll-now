Today turned out to be a pretty nice day. I love Fridays like this. I just got back from my son's Halloween parade. Damn, those kids can be so cute. They all marched around the parking lot, led by their principle, who was dressed as a dalamation. Cody went as Harry Potter. Along with 18 other kids. Seems to be the popular thing this year.

Gail and I (and the kids) are going to a halloween party tomorrow night. Gail and I are going to go as Thing 1 and Thing 2. We got the idea from a couple of the kids at the parade. Easy costumes, and pretty cool too. Cody and Sarah are going to a sock hop at the school tonight. And with Gail at work, I get to watch Friends in relative peace tonight. Sweet!
