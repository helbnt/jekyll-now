Welp. It's been awhile. I was hosting my personal site under the [Harleyroads.com](https://www.harleyroads.com) domain, but in December I let that lapse because I didn't want to pay another 100+ bucks.

My brother Seth said he was going to be able to host my site(s), so I just cancelled the service and waited. I created a new look for the site while waiting, and while there's still some stuff to do, I like the layout and look, and can hopefully stick with this one for awhile (I'm really bad at sticking to a layout...)

Now hopefully I can get back into the habit of using Blogger to write my thoughts down.
