Hurricane Charley, which originally was supposed to be quite the downpour, turned out to be nothing more than an afternoon of soft, steady rain. Today has been beautiful, with a slight breeze and a very comfortable 75 degrees. I should be outside mowing the lawn and such, but yard work is yard work.

With Gail being gone (she’s out in Arizona visiting her parents and then she’ll be back with the kids on Thursday), I’ve been mostly just hanging out and watching TV. Being a slug in other words. Before leaving, Gail instructed Marcia to take me shopping at J.C. Penny’s, as they are having a sale. I actually bought clothes for myself. Which is odd; I never buy clothes for myself.

Hopefully the problems with the hardware that hosts my website has been fixed. Apparently the hard drive went south, and after that was replaced, the RAID controller went. Lots of fun.

It would appear that storms of all sorts have to be weathered.
