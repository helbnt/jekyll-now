For some reason, ["Classical Gas"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEzyrpfrPEI), that catchy guitar piece by [Mason Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Williams) has been in my WinAmp player alot lately. I have versions done by Chet Atkins, California Guitar Trio, and The Boston Pops. I just can't get enough of this song at the moment.

Spent the weekend either riding or cleaning. And getting my butt whooped at Starcraft. I packed the bike and did a quick 100 mile run, getting the kinks outta the packing job. Don't want to have a load shift on me as I'm doing 70mph down a freeway somewhere. That wouldn't be good!!

Countdown - 2 days, 21 hours, 35minutes.

And it'll probably seem like 2 days, 21 hours, and 350000000 minutes.
