Fall is definitely in the air. While I am still wearing shorts, there was a nice chill in house when I awoke this morning. It didn't help that I left the windows open and the fan on, even though it was supposed to get down to the mid-40s. I love sleeping in the cold weather.

Things are pretty much going along as they always have, with the exception that I'm not near as busy any more. It seems to be feast or famine here at work, and seeing as how it was busier than all get out all during the summer, I don't mind a few weeks worth of famine. I can catch up on school work, and my websites. It also gives me time to do a few more things around the house, and I don't feel as tired. Unfortunatly, with the lack of work goes the OT. So it looks as if I'll be trying to find a second job. Here's where we find out if my mom actually reads this journal, because if I do get another job, I won't be able to make it to her place for Thanksgiving :(

And in other news, I know have brough home yet another computer. However, it's NOT a windows machine! I have downstairs a nice, more-or-less brand new Macintosh G4. This thing is sweet. Between that and my Mac G3 Powerbook, I'm slowing moving away from the windows enviroment. I still use it for Games and some other stuff, but I really like the macs. I've decided I'm just going use what is the best for each app. I'm getting Photoshop and Dreamweaver for the mac, and seeing as how that's what I use at school, it makes sense to use them at home as well. I'll still play games on my Windows machine. And once I get my linux box set up, I'll see about installing CVS and backing up stuff so that I don't have a repeat of my HD crashing with nothing, and I mean Nothing with a capital N, backed up.

No, it was not a pretty sight. I think I cried a bit.

As for the rest of the family, everything is the same. Cody still gets scolded on a regular basis for not paying attention in class, or not bringing home all his homework, or just being a 9-year-old in general. Sarah has been saying "Is tomorrow my birthday?" for the entire past month. Unfortunatly, it's not until the end of THIS month. She might drive her parents crazy by that time. Gail is still working, still being supermom. And myself, well, it's the same as well: Work School Homework Housework, repeat as necessary....
