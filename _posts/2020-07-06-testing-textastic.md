Once again, testing to see if I can figure out an ipad solution. I think I have several "testing" posts now floating around in the ether. Not sure where they disappeared to.

Oh well. Take 424235!

_edit_

Whoa. Holy crap, did I actually get this working? Did I find a solution that actually works?

If I smoked, I'd go have a cigarette. This has been a long process in getting this all setup. I'd rather have used iA Writer, and that's strickly because it's just a more elegant program for writing, but honestly, right now, Textastic is bombastic.

I'll worry about iA Writer later. For now, let's get comfortable with Textastic and Working Copy.
