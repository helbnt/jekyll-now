In one of my previous entries, I mentioned that I have a hard time getting
better than proficient at something:

Like any piece of creative software, whether it be [Affinity's Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) or [Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/), [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview), or [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/) (Bitwig's main competitor in the DAW field), they're
all easy enough to do something basic up front, but the real power comes from
digging deeper, and learning the ins-and-outs of the software. And of course,
the more one digs, the more complicated the software can become. Bitwig is no
different, so I've been trying to break it down into smaller bits, making the
knowledge easier to digest. The smaller bits also help with trying to keep
focus, an issue I'm constantly struggling with.

I'm not, however, taking a very practical approach. It would make sense to start
at a high level, learning the basic interface to an expert level. I know the
basics well enough to feel comfortable working through the project.

Bitwig's InterfaceSo yeah, that looks complicated and crazy, but I feel
comfortable enough with it that I don't need to focus on it. Instead, I've
chosen to start my deep dive with one of the synths that Bitwig provides.
Phase-4 is a four oscillator, phase-manipulation synth. Each oscillator is
identical in purpose, and differentiated by color: red, blue, yellow, and
magenta (why they just didn't call it purple...). The four oscillators are fed
into a global filter area, and there's also a global area to the left of the
filters that house the pitch, glide, shape and mod.

Phase-4 InterfaceBreaking it down to just the one of the oscillators, the
primary control for each is the Shape knob, which affects the overall amount of
phase distortion applied. Right above the Shape knob is a menu which you can
click and drag to change the oscillator setting. These will be familiar
settings, with Sine, Saw, Pulse Width, etc. This changes the algorithm for the
phase distortion.

As an aside, there's a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxbjFyWEXyg)
from [Dave Linnenbank](http://davelinnenbank.com/) that talks about Phase
Synthesis. In the video he's using Bitwig, but the principles apply to other
DAWs and even analog synths. Watch it if you're at all confused about this
particular form of synthesis. I certainly was/am/will be.

The Mod knob (heh) next to the Shape knob sets the maximum amount of phase
modulation allowed from any source. And the four smaller knobs to the right of
the Mod are setting the individual levels of modulation, each associated with
their oscillator based on their color.

Now multiply that all by four. Four oscillators each with four ways to modulate
the other oscillators and you have a tool for creating some very rich sounds.
There's much more to say about the Phase-4 synth, and I've barely scratched the
surface. I'm hoping to play with this more in the future, and update this post
(or even create a new one) with some examples of the sort of sounds you can
create using the Phase-4 Synth.
