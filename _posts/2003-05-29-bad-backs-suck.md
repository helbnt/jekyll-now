title: Bad Backs Suck

Between standing for hours on end at the state HOG rally, Jeff and Marcia’s wedding (at which I was a groomsman), dancing at the reception afterwards, having Cody walk on my back and then *jump* off, and picking up a 21in monitor, I torqued my back somehow. Went to the doctor yesterday, and he gave me some muscle relaxers, but they don’t seem to be helping much. I ended up getting up at 3am to sleep in the recliner with the heating pad.
