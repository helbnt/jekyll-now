My friend Bill and I have been playing poker together for a number of years now, usually with the same core group of people with a few “outsiders” mixed in now and then for variety (and to fill an empty spot on the table). Bill is an excellent poker player. He counts cards, knows the odds, and can do some impressive calculations in his head. So it’s the rule more than the exception that he generally walks away from the table ahead for the night.

Last night we had an impromptu poker game and instead of our usual five-dollar buy-in and dealer’s choice, we made it ten dollars and just straight Texas Hold ‘Em. You might know the game from the popular World Series of Poker tour on ESPN, as well as The Travel Channel’s World Poker Tour.

We’ve played this a few times and Bill usually comes out the winner, not surprising considering his skills with the cards. And last night it came down to the two of us. Jeff, after losing his stack had left and gone home early. Christy, who was next out, stayed and was our dealer for awhile (thanks again Christy!). Eventually she had to go home as well. This turned out to be the latest we’ve ever played. Christy threw in the towel around 2:30 this morning.

I was bound and determined to win last night, as I’ve yet to win a Hold ‘Em pot. Because it was winner takes all, the pot was forty bucks, and I wanted it! But it was grueling: I had a chip advantage over Bill and was being patient, just picking at him, fifty cents here, two bucks there. I would be doing fairly well, and then he’d put in a big bet. I’d have something halfway decent (or think he was bluffing) and call him on it, and he’d win.

About 3:15 A. M., we got down to where I had about a 3 to 1 chip advantage (just a guess, really). The cards were dealt and I had pocket tens ("pockets” refers to the two down cards for those of you who don’t play poker ;). I bumped the blind by a buck, Bill shrugged and said “All in” (meaning he bets his entire stack of chips) and I quickly followed. We flipped the cards over: he had a king and a non-suited low card. My two tens were looking good. Here came the flop: King, King, seven. Of all the luck. He’d not only matched his kings, but twice. The rest of the cards were junk, and Bill doubled up on his chips.

I still had the advantage though. Two plays later, I was dealt pocket Jacks. Again I bumped the bet. This time, Bill bumped me back. Now it was my turn to pounce. All in was my call, and Bill followed suit. Thankfully, my pocket Jacks had what it took and I won the game.

Finally.

Trying to get to sleep was a nightmare. I kept replaying the hands in my head, scolding myself for being too easy to bluff, and not being more aggressive. I last looked at the clock at 4:08 A.M. I told myself not to look anymore. I awoke at 7:15, and was into work by 8:30. Man, is today going to be a looooong day.

Buy hey. I won Texas Hold ‘Em. Look out Unabomber. I’ve got my sights set on you!
