Cold ride in this morning. Yup, back on the bike. Was supposed to go on a poker run this weekend, but that was cancelled. Riding to our meeting point early on Saturday morning, it was cold and way foggy. Because of the chill, I ended up getting some chaps. Now I have warm legs. Hooray for me.

Spent yesterday washing my bike, then my buddy Jeff and I took the kids to Best Buy. We picked up some network cards, and some cables, and hooked my two machines up together. Now we can play [Starcraft](https://starcraft.com/en-us/)!!! Hooray for us.

Today, I'm going to try and get my voting script and my forum working on my Harleyroads site. We'll see how that goes. I imagine I'll end up banging my head in frustration more often than not.<br /><br />
