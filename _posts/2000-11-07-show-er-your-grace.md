Man, slippery tubs sucks. I was in the shower this morning, and the wife hopped in. As I was maneuvering around so she could get under the showerhead, I slipped, both feet going out from under me at the same time.

Naturally, I was against the shower curtain, and not the wall when I did this. Went ass backwards right out of the shower, hit my back against the corner of the counter, and flopped on down to the bathroom floor, where I managed not to yell out all sorts of obscenities.

Now I have a wonderful cut/bruise up my back (about 4 inches long...damn sharp counter top!) and it hurts to rotate my right arm around, as it's sore. Geezus, I tell ya, when it rains, it pours.
