Hooray...I think I've gotten all my Xmas shopping done. I think. I hope.

In all honesty, it's NEVER done. Someone gives you a gift out of the blue, you feel as if you should return the favor. You see the one thing, **The One Thing** that would make a perfect gift for someone 2 days before Xmas. It never ends. There's people who go to the after xmas sales to start stocking up for next year. Ugh.

Not much going here at work now. We finished our big project, and as everyone else is slowing down for the holidays, there's not much to do. So, whilst I'm at work, I'm going to work on getting my new layout working with my journal. It's gonna be interesting. Wish me luck!!!
