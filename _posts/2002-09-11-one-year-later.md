One year ago, I was sitting in my manager's office watching the news unfold on the TV. The astonishment that someone could actually run into one of the tallest buildings in the world. Then the chilling horror as the second plane hit the other building. By this time, a crowd was in my managers office watching. I will never forget the collective gasp that went up when the second plane hit, and everyone realized that this was no accident.

My brother lives in New York city. He had a job interview scheduled for 9am at the World Trade Center complex. Thankfully, my brother has never been able to get up early to save his life (and I guess, it might have), and had rescheduled it for 2pm that afternoon. He actually slept through the crashes until a friend of his called to check on him. He got online and IM'd me to let me know he was ok. 

I live outside of Washington D.C. After hearing that there was smoke coming from the Pentagon, they made an announcement that everyone was to go home. I've never made it home so fast. 

The days events unfolded in my living room on my TV. We had friends and neighbors over, as well as my in-laws (who were supposed to leave that day and ended up spending an extra week). 

Family and Friends. That's what's become important for me this past year. Spending time with my children, reading them a story before bed. Remebering to tell them, and my wife, that I love them.

A year later, and personally, not much has changed. Politically, I think Bush has lost his focus, and is starting to lose respect, among Americans and among other countries. Let's concentrate on one thing at a time, eh Dubya?
