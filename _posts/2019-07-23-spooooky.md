In a [previous post](https://i-am.ski/sometimes-too-many-choices-is-a-bad-thing/)
, I mentioned that I had installed [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) "just because".
Which essentially means I can't leave well enough alone. In this case it turned
out to be a good decision.

While I did like the flat-file structure of Grav, I was getting annoyed by
several minor things, which added up to me deciding to just say "Screw it!", and
install Ghost as my CMS of choice. The install of Ghost was a bit trickier, due
to [my host](https://www.dreamhost.com), but I found a [good guide](https://techsparx.com/nodejs/deployment/dreamhost-passenger-ghost.html) to get
me through and within the hour, I had it setup and running. I only had six
entries from my Grav install, and I had copied those to a text file previously.
So it was a fairly painless process to post them in Ghost and get them tagged as
I saw fit. Then I zipped up the theme I was using on my localhost ([mnml](https://github.com/curiositry/mnml-ghost-theme), with
some changes specific to me. Again, I found another [how-to](https://grantwinney.com/how-to-customize-the-default-casper-theme-in-ghost/) to
accomplish that), uploaded it, and I'm happy with the result.

So far.

Hopefully, I will leave well enough alone. I'm sure I'll have some small changes
here and there I want to fix, but overall, I should be good to go for the most
part. Now it's time to get back to learning. Javascript will be my main focus.
Or at least, should be. I did just upgrade to [Bitwig 3](https://www.bitwig.com).
That's been a lot of fun to play with.
