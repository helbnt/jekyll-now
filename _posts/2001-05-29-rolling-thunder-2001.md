What a killer weekend. Rolling Thunder. Wow....the sound of 200K Harleys taking off is amazing. And to be in that pack, riding around the nations capital was something else. I can't wait to do it again next year. However, this week...looks like it's time to strip the bike...take the tanks and fenders off, and ship them off to get painted. Eeeek!
