The end of the school year is the herald of vacation for millions of people across America, and so it is with my family clan this year, 2004. It’s not often we get to travel on vacations together, with either myself or Gail having to work, but this year, with the help of generous in-laws, we all managed to take time together to fly out to visit family and friends. It was also a time to reaquaint ourselves with the majesty that is the Southwest…

After a 2 hour delay, we arrived in Phoenix at midnight local time, meaning it was 3a.m. back home. The kids (and adults) were exhausted. Fortunately my aunt and uncle were there to pick us up and usher us sleepy travelers to their house, with soft beds and the promise of not needing to be up before lunchtime. Naturally, my internal clock decided that 6a.m. was plenty of sleep-in time, so I was awake with the roosters.

We had a nice morning, Gail and I watching the kids splash in the pool while we sat in the shade. I’d forgetten that was possible here. Back home, when it’s 95 degrees out, in the shade - thanks to the humidity - it still feels as if it’s 95 degrees. Here, shade drops the tempature noticably, and makes sitting out with the kids bearable.

Lunch time saw us visiting with my grandmother. Hopefully she’s forgiven me for coming through last time and not stopping to see her (Before everyone gets riled up, I had a good excuse; my father was in the hospital in Flagstaff, and I was anxious to get up there). We had a nice afternoon, checking out her new house, and the clubhouse of the community she’s moved into. That evening we were back at my aunt and uncles’ for dinner, and the next morning, Gail’s parents picked us up to travel to Colorado.

We had a brief stop in Flagstaff to visit with my dad, and then it was on to Grand Junction, CO., to visit with Gail’s brother and his family. We had a nice visit, touring the dinosaur museum and dig site, and visiting downtown Grand Junction. Sunday we had a nice picnic at a park right along the Colorado River, and then Monday, our plans to go whitewater rafting were rained out. I had planned on staying with my sister-in-law, as she’d recently broken her wrist, so I didn’t feel cheated out of a whitewater trip, but I think Gail was disappointed. We were in Glenwood Springs, and it’s quite the picturesque town. I fell in love, and if I can ever manage, I just might have to look into moving there.

We travelled south on 82 into Aspen. What a beautiful, pricey, artistic, pricey, charming and pricey little town. It was chilly that day, and not being accustomed to the wet and cold weather, I was noticibly cold in my shorts and t-shirt. I thought maybe I’d get a sweatshirt or something. I checked a few prices in a few different shops, and the cheapest sweatshirt was $110.

I figured I’d just be chilly.

Tuesday we travelled on back to Flagstaff by way of Monument Valley and took a bunch of pictures. Gail’s parents went as far as Flagstaff with us, and then headed on down the Tucson the following Wednesday. Gail and the kids and I spent the next few days roaming around town with no real agenda, and spent the evenings visiting with my Dad and his long time girlfriend Laurie. We hiked down Walnut Canyon to the Indian ruins, visited downtown (It has changed so much since I’ve left), and generally relaxed. There was a forest fire burning about 20 miles south of Flagstaff, and I managed to get a couple of photos of the smoke.

Last night was spent with some old friends from college in Phoenix, and now I’m sitting here in my in-law’s house in Tucson. We’re going to a party tonight, and then tomorrow I get to visit all my old friends. 

So here’s to old friends! Hope to see you all soon. And to all my new(ish) friends back home in Virginia, we’ll be seeing you all soon.
