I _think_ the end goal that I have in mind for this website — aside from the obviousness of blogging — is to be able to update from wherever I am. As I’ve switched to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), this isn’t as easy a task to accomplish, as say, something built on [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org), or even [Grav](https://www.getgrav.org). Both of those CMS’s have Admin areas that you load up in a browser to compose your pages in. As far as I know there’s no admin plugin available for Jekyll. Not that I’ve looked that hard.

I’m intending to write most my posts on my iPad. ~~I know there are various Markdown editors available, but currently I’m using the iOS version of Scrivener. I’ve setup a project where I’ll write my posts, that is currently synced to Dropbox.~~ Currently I’m using [iA Writer](ia.net), and will hopefully get this to sync with Dropbox, or similar. This isn’t something that’ll be completely fool proof anytime soon. After all, I’m quite the fool and excel and breaking stuff. I’ve also finally uploaded the site to the domain, so I’m not just talking to myself on my local machine. Now I’m talking to myself in the great wide open digital domain.

There are still a few things to button up before I’m completely happy:

- Being able to creat a post and seamlessly upload it to _i-am.ski_
- I haven’t tested how images will look yet
- Still need to setup RSS Feeds (not that I’m at all popular, but you never know and it’d be nice to have them setup in advance. Besides, once they’re in place, they’re low-maintenance)
- Fix the icon in the footer
- Get descriptions for each category in place
- Code refactoring; I suspect there’s a lot of unused CSS that I could remove
- Setup a [/now](https://nownownow.com) page
	
Otherwise, I feel pretty good about the state of the site. Good enough to currently show it to the public at least. The list above can be worked on in my spare time.
