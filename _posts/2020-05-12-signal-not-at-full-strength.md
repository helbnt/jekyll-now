I'm not having as much luck as I'd hope getting an iPad-only solution to posting entries here. I can't get my Dropbox to sync after following [Tyler Hall](https://tyler.io/publishing-your-blog-with-dropbox-and-jekyll/)'s entry. I know it's possible...but maybe not possible with my host, which is currently a VPS on Dreamhost. I'm sure it __is__... I've just not been smart enough to figure it out as of yet.

Another option which I think I'll explore is utilizing [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and point the i-am.ski domain there. Assuming I can get it working (Github Pages has built-in support for Jekyll right out of the box), there will be the added benefit of becoming more comfortable with Git. I use Git daily at work, and while I'm not near as gun-shy as I used to be, if anything goes awry and I need to use some other git commands, then I tend to get a bit nervous. Particularly when I end up having merge conflicts, or similar issues. 

Otherwise, isolation goes on. Given the time I've been spending in my basement where my home office is, I've been wondering how hard it'd be to add another window. Probably more money than I want to spend on this house.
