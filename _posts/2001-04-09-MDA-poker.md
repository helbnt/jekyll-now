title: MDA Poker & Being Yuppies
---

We had an "MDA Poker" night this past Saturday. Basically, you came to play poker, but all the money you put in went to the [MDA](http://www.mda.org). However, we had some nice prizes to give away, like a $25 gift certificate to [Macaroni Grill](http://www.macaronigrill.com/), $10 and \$5 gift certificates to [Blockbuster](http://www.blockbuster.com), and some fun stuff, like a bin full of [Ring Pops](https://www.candywarehouse.com/ring-pops-24-piece-box) and [Tootsie-Roll Pops](https://www.tootsie.com/).

We had a good time. Bill-a-bong was the big winner for the night, and he took the Macaroni Grill certificate (Thanks Deb!)

Other than that, we spent the weekend as your typical suburbanite yuppie couple might: did housework all day Saturday, and did yardwork most the day Sunday. Blah. Didn't get to go riding at all. Double-Blah. The muscles between my thumbs and forefingers are all sore from raking. Triple-Blah. Blah Blah Blah.

Ok, enough blahs. Gail's going to Tampa for a few days, for work related reasons. However, she and her partner in crime managed to score a nice hotel, and a convertible rental. Supposed to be mid-80's down there all week. They're going to be lovin' it. As long as I don't see them on the news jumping into a canyon ala Thelma and Louise, then I won't worry.
