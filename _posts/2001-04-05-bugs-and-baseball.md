Last night was Cody's play, titled "Bugs". In it, Cody played a firefly. All the first and second graders were there, all dressed up as various bugs. It was very cute. Cody was a firefly. When it came time for their song, the broke out with the flashlights, and the lights were gradually dimmed as the song went on. By the end, they had turned out every light, and it was just a bunch of flashlights up on stage. It was really neat.

Cody did very well, both Gail and I were really proud of him. He had a line in the play, and when his turn came, he stepped right up to the mic without a hint of stage fright, and said his line in a perfectly clear, understandable voice. He even added some emphasis right were is was need. Hrm...perhaps the next Harrison Ford?

Baseball has also started for Cody. He's on the Mariners this year. This should be an...interesting year. Cody's coach told us the first day of practice that he wasn't going to be there for most the season. So it's fallen onto my, and other parents shoulders to coach this team. **sigh**

Other than that, things move along. Gail and I figured out we owe over 10k in taxes. Bleah. I have a poker run on Saturday. Hooray! And time keeps moving on and on and on and on...

...but I digress.
