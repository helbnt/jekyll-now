### /Now

**Reading**<br>
"Free Wrench" by Joseph R. Lallo. 
"The Dark" by Jason Brant.

**Just Finished**
"Little Brother" by Corey Doctorow

**Watching**
"Mr. Robot" is the current binge.

**Listening**
Jellyfish Sunrise Radio on Spotify
Tom Cosm

**Overall**
Just trying to survive with my sanity intact during these crazy political and pandemic times. Experimenting more with creating music, using [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com). Anything to ignore the shit storm outside my door.
