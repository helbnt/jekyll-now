**Reading**<br>
Words of Radience, by Brandon Sanderson<br />


**Just Finished**<br />
Discworld, by Terry Pratchett<br />
Full Throttle, by Joe Hill


**Watching**<br>
Ragnarok<br>
Schitt's Creek<br>

**Listening**<br>
Going through my old LPs; Iron Maiden to Linda Rondstat. Good to get up and stretch every 20-30 mins to flip the album over.

**Overall**<br>
The Brood X Cicada swarm was cool at first, but I'm ready for them to go back underground.
